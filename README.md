## Primary Analysis: 

1. Identify the top 3 and bottom 3 cities by total trips over the entire analysis period.

</p>

5. Compare the total trips taken on weekdays versus weekends for each city over the six-month period. Identify cities with a strong preference for either weekend or weekday trips to understand demand variations.

6. Identify which cities contribute most to higher trip frequencies among repeat passengers, and examine if there are distinguishable patterns between tourism-focused and business-focused cities.

</p>

7. For each city, evaluate monthly performance against targets for total trips, new passengers, and average passenger ratings. Determine if each metric met, exceeded, or missed the target, and calculate the percentage difference.

8. Identify the top 2 and bottom 2 cities based on their RPR% to determine which locations have the strongest and weakest rates. Similarly, analyze the RPR% by month across all cities and identify the months with the highest and lowest repeat passenger rates.

## Insights

1) GoodCabs generates 70% of its revenue from tourists and 30% from business commuters.

2) Peak demand in Feb, April, May is due to festivals, holidays, and vacations, while Jan and June face low demand from post-holiday slowdown and monsoon.

3) Passengers with higher repeat trip counts take 2-3 trips, and business cities have more trips on weekdays than weekends, while tourism cities see the opposite trend.

4) Jaipur outperforming all other cities in trips, revenue, ratings, and targets.
  However, it faces challenges with repeat passenger rates and new passenger targets (-15%), indicating:
   - Low passenger loyalty
  - Insufficient tailored marketing
  This pattern is common across Tourism-focused cities
- Jaipur's strong performance is largely driven by its tourist attraction.

5) Surat, a business hub, has the highest repeat passenger rate (50%) due to lower trip costs and frequent business travel needs.
  However, it struggles with:
  - Achieving trip and ratings targets
  - Lowest passenger and driver ratings
This trend is common in business-focused cities and highlights service quality issues.

## Recommendations

- GoodCabs should focus on tailored marketing and brand awareness by offering free trips after 5 successful referrals to boost both brand visibility and passenger loyalty.

- GoodCabs should enhance service quality and offer perks to drivers, especially in business hubs like Surat and Vadodara.

- GoodCabs should actively collect customer reviews and implement feedback quickly to improve customer satisfaction.

- GoodCabs should run targeted campaigns and partner with established brands in tourist spots to increase reach, offering lower trip costs or profit sharing.

- GoodCabs should implement EVs and urban technology in business hubs to reduce operating costs, where profits are lower due to shorter trip distances and lower fares.
